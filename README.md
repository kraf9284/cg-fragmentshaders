# CG Fragment Shaders
For this project, I created 5 different video filters using WebGL fragment shaders. The first four which are Black & White, Fish Eye, Ripple, and Toonify, were the ones we were instructed to make but the fifth which is a thermal/heat intensity filter was my own choice to make. We were provided with starter code for each shader, and had to fill in the math/code for the filters within the starter code. This project was really interesting because it provided me with an opportunity to learn more about how to use WebGL and Babylon JS and what it is capable of. I didn't know that making these sorts of filters was such a simple thing to do, or what sort of programming went into doing so. It reminded me of the kinds of filters you can find on snapchat or on the Photobooth app on Mac devices.
